```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

pacman::p_load(readr, tidyr, broom)

- Here we will get the data. I am using a file with player data from a casino on how much each player has spent on particular games
```{r data, echo=FALSE, include=FALSE}
CasinoData <- read_csv("CasinoData.csv")

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}

```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
